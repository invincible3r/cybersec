What are Cookies?
You may have heard of the term cookies before but what exactly are they and how can they affect the security of your computer?
A cookie is a text file which is placed on your computer whenever you visit a website. This cookie allows the website to keep track of your visit details and store your preferences. The main objective here is to increase the speed with which you visit that same website again. At the same time, they are very useful for advertisers who can match the ads to your interests after they see your browsing history. 
Usually, cookies and temporary files may affect your privacy since they disclose your online habits, but it is possible to modify your web browser preferences and set a limit.

Mobile Device Management
Mobile Device Management is the industry term that deals with deploying, securing, monitoring, integrating and managing mobile devices in the workplace.
The primary objective is to optimize functionality and security of mobile devices. 
There are different types of MDM software that allows the distribution of applications, data and configuration settings and patches for such devices.  Ideally the software should be able to allow IT administrators to manage and troubleshoot mobile devices remotely.
Actionable Steps for Personal Security
Lets talk about actionable steps that you can take today to better protect yourself against cyber attacks and malware
Use a strong password
One of  the easiest things you can do right now. Make sure your password is at least 8 characters in length and has a combination of letters, numbers and a special character. 
Password Variety
Even if you have got the strongest password in the world, it's not a good idea to just one password for all your accounts. Try to come up with 2 or even 3 variations of your main password and use those as well for some accounts. An alternative here would be to use password managers like Dashlane or LastPass.
Deploy Multi Factor Authentication Methods
Several websites and applications like Gmail recommend a second means of verifying who you are such as receiving a text message with a code on your phone when attempting to log in from a different computer. This extra layer of security can make a huge difference so please do it.
Use an Antivirus
You already know why you should. If you want a recommendation, I highly recommend using Kaspersky.
Watch out for HTTPS
As we discussed in the Protocols class, HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP and should be used on sites where important information like credit card details are provided. Whenever you are on such a site, make sure that you can see the secure padlock sign in the address bar that shows HTTPS
Change your routers default password
If you have an internet router at home, take 10 minutes now to change the default password now if you haven't.
Use a standard account
On a daily basis I highly recommend you use a non administrative account on your computer. This means that even if you get infected with a malware, it wouldn't be able to do much damage. In other words, no admin rights = no admin privileges to infect your PC.  
Be cautious at all times
Always double check anything you download to your computer. Think twice before clicking on that link you receive in your email. Be extremely wary of free applications.
Don't store sensitive data on your PC
If you have got important files like scanned copies of very important documents, you are better off storing them on a detachable flash drive that you can always plug into your computer and use when you have to.
Section Review and Key Points
Welcome to the section review.  Below are the key takeaways from this section
•	MAC addresses are unique to network adapters but IP addresses can be changed all the time
•	Switches are primarily used to connect devices to a network. Routers are used to connect networks together.
•	Ethernet aka IEEE 802.3 is the protocol used to determine how data is transferred in a LAN
•	SSL/TLS are the primary protocols used to encrypt and secure data transferred over the internet between a browser and a web server.
•	The Internet Protocol Suite aka TCP/IP is a collection of protocols that govern the entire journey of data sent from one host or network to another.
•	The DNS is essentially the phone book of the internet. It translates domain names into IP addresses
•	Every DNS server has a list of all the root servers that they contact in case they can't match a domain name to an IP address
What are Cookies?
•	You may have heard of the term cookies before but what exactly are they and how can they affect the security of your computer?
•	A cookie is a text file which is placed on your computer whenever you visit a website. This cookie allows the website to keep track of your visit details and store your preferences. The main objective here is to increase the speed with which you visit that same website again. At the same time, they are very useful for advertisers who can match the ads to your interests after they see your browsing history. 
•	Usually, cookies and temporary files may affect your privacy since they disclose your online habits, but it is possible to modify your web browser preferences and set a limit.
•	cookies can be cleared from your browser
       
                             SUPER COOKIES
•	A very special type of cookie is called the super cookie and an example of such is the 'evercookie'. As the name suggests, this particular cookie is ever present in your computer despite your attempts to get rid of it. Its able to achieve this because unlike regular cookies that are stored in one location, the evercookie stores cookie data in several places – for example, in Flash cookies, your browsing history, and HTML5 local storage. 
•	A very clever tracking method the evercookie employs is to assign a unique color value to a few pixels every time a new user visits a website. The different colors are stored in each user’s browser cache and can be loaded back. The color value of the pixels is a unique identifier that identifies the user.
•	When a website notices that you’ve deleted part of the super cookie, the information is repopulated from the other location. For example, you might clear your browser cookies but not your Flash cookies, so the website will copy the value of the Flash cookie to your browser cookies. Super cookies are very resilient.
•	Some of the best methods of fighting against super cookies is to avoid running Adobe Flash or Microsoft Silverlight in your browser as these two apps are used by super cookies to replicate themselves. Using VPN services like Tunnel Bear or Tor is perhaps the best way of fighting cookies.
